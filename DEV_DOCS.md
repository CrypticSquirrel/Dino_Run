## Developer Documentation



### (My) Development Environment 

**vscode**
- You can download vscode from their [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or using brew (command below)

```
brew cask install visual-studio-code
```

**github desktop**
- Although vscode has built in source control and git can be run on the command line, I prefer [github's desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/). because I can view all my projects in one place.



**brew**
- If you are on a mac, [brew](https://brew.sh/) is the best thing ever. Consider getting it.
