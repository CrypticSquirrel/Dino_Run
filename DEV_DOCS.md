## Developer Documentation

### Git

- I found the best way to work with on a project with two people is with a 3 branch system. A master branch and two working branches (one for each of us)
- I would create your own branch from master. See below on where to do this. Just enter text and press enter:

### (My) Development Environment 

**vscode**
- You can download vscode from their [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or using brew (command below)

```
brew cask install visual-studio-code
```

**useful vscode extensions**
- For this project I would recommend `live server` and `p5js Snippets`
- Download extensions by clicking the fourth tab down on the left (it looks like building blocks)

**github desktop**
- Although vscode has built in source control and git can be run on the command line, I prefer [github's desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/). because I can view all my projects in one place.


**brew**
- If you are on a mac, [brew](https://brew.sh/) is the best thing ever. Consider getting it.
